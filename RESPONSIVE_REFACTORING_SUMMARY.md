## Key Responsive Techniques Used

### 1. CSS Functions
- **`clamp(min, preferred, max)`**: For fluid typography and spacing
- **`min()`** and **`max()`**: For constrained sizing
- **Viewport units (`vw`, `vh`)**: For responsive scaling relative to viewport

### 2. Grid and Flexbox
- **CSS Grid**: `repeat(auto-fit, minmax(320px, 1fr))` for responsive grids
- **Flexbox**: `flex-wrap: wrap` for responsive navigation and layouts
- **Mobile-first approach**: Start with single column, expand for larger screens

### 3. Media Queries
- **Mobile-first breakpoints**: 480px, 768px, 1024px, 1200px
- **Responsive grid classes**: `.md-2`, `.lg-3`, `.xl-4` etc.
- **Device-specific utilities**: `.hide-mobile`, `.hide-desktop`

### 4. Accessibility Improvements
- **Minimum touch targets**: 44px height for interactive elements
- **Focus management**: Consistent focus outlines
- **Reduced motion support**: `prefers-reduced-motion`
- **High contrast support**: `prefers-contrast`

## Browser Compatibility
- Modern browsers supporting CSS Grid and Flexbox
- Responsive design works on all screen sizes from 320px to 4K displays
- Graceful degradation for older browsers

## Performance Optimizations
- Used CSS custom properties for consistent theming
- Minimized reflows with proper box-sizing
- Optimized animations and transitions
- Efficient use of clamp() for reduced JavaScript dependency

## Testing Recommendations
1. **Mobile devices**: Test on actual devices (iOS/Android)
2. **Screen readers**: Verify accessibility with screen reader software
3. **Different browsers**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
4. **Viewport sizes**: 320px, 768px, 1024px, 1440px, 1920px+
5. **Orientation changes**: Portrait and landscape modes

## Implementation Notes
- All components now use consistent responsive patterns
- No horizontal scrolling on any screen size
- Images scale properly with `max-width: 100%`
- Text remains readable at all screen sizes
- Interactive elements meet accessibility guidelines
- Smooth transitions between breakpoints

This refactoring ensures the Kalakritam website provides an excellent user experience across all devices and screen sizes while maintaining the original design aesthetic and functionality.
